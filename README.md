Instructions

1. run preprocess.py

	- Running this will preprocess and save the data.
	- After running there will be files named X_test.csv, X_train.csv, y_test.csv,
	  and y_train.csv in the 'processed_data' folder.

2. run train_mlp.py or train_knn.py

	- Running this will train and save the corresponding algorithm.
	- After running there will be a file named mlp.pkl or knn.pkl in the 'models'
	  folder.

3. run test_mlp.py or test_knn.py

	- Running this will produce a confusion matrix and classification report with
	  the algorithms accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.
